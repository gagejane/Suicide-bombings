In June of 1981, eight men were arrested and indicted on charges of racketeering and extortion, including the murders of Cikoja and Brkic, and several arsons.

Whitfield survived and was treated for his wounds.

One incendiary device was placed in a recycling dumpster at the southwest corner of the ranger station, and the second was planted on the outside of one of the walls of the station, causing an estimated $3,316,150 in damages to replace the building, and $1,758,039 for the contents, for a total loss of $5,074,189, in addition to a vast amount of lost research material.

Sands still maintained that he was against development of preserved areas, but also that he ""knew how to sell it,"" ""knew what a god media story was, and ""there was a sense of power"" behind the string of incidents that the media fed on.

The vehicle was parked on 45th Street, between Seventh and Eighth Avenues.","05/01/2010: On Saturday evening at approximately 1830, in New York City, New York, United States of America, a t-shirt vendor located between 45th Street and Seventh and Eighth Avenues noticed a dark-colored Sport Utility Vehicle (SUV) parked at the curb with its engine running and its hazard lights on. Officer Wayne Rhatigan, a member of the New York Police Department's mounted division, was alerted by the vendor and then approached the vehicle and looked inside, where he spotted a box that was smoking and was able to smell gunpowder. The NYPD Bomb Squad was called to the scene, where they deployed a robotic device to break the SUV's back windows and to observe what was inside the vehicle. In the vehicle, police discovered the following: three 20-gallon propane canisters; two five-gallon cans of gasoline; 40+ consumer-grade M-88 firecrackers that had been placed inside of a 20-ounce metal container that had been wrapped in duct tape; a 55-inch by 32-inch green metal locker that contained eight plastic bags that held a total of approximately 250 pounds of Urea based fertilizer, a metal pressure cooker pot containing wires and an additional 120 M-88 firecrackers. The vehicle, a dark blue 1993 Nissan Pathfinder with tinted windows, had license plates that were registered to a Ford pickup truck that had been taken to a junkyard near Bridgeport, Connecticut some time during the last half of April (license plate: 98C Y09). Additionally, the vehicle identification number (VIN) had been removed from the SUV. No casualties were reported and no group immediately claimed responsibility. However, on 05/02/2010, the Taliban posted a video on YouTube claiming responsibility for the event, saying that it was revenge for the killing of Baitullah Mehsur, Abu Omar al-Baghdadi and Abu Ayyub al-Masri. The group did not make specific mention of the car bomb or New York City, so authorities doubt the authenticity of the Pakistani Taliban's involvement.
